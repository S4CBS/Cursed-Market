# Cursed Market
A multifunctional program providing free, temporary access to all in-game privileges: iconic characters, their customization elements, and gameplay modifiers (items, addons, and perks). During gameplay interactions, internet requests are intercepted before reaching the game servers, reducing the risk of penalties for "rule-breaking".

## Guaranteed Quest Completion
1) You need to open the archives and select the quest you want to complete;
2) Start a match as a survivor or killer (depending on who the quest is for); some quests can be completed with either role;
3) After finishing the match, return to the archives and click the quest with the left mouse button; it will be marked as completed.

**P.S:** Quest completion will count regardless of the match type, including games against bots. Keep in mind that completing quests in private matches with bots may raise more suspicion, as the game does not typically support such scenarios by default.

## Simple Timer
Can't always measure the required time interval correctly, missing by just a few seconds? To enable this feature, launch the program using "Cursed Market - Timer Feature.bat" or run "Cursed Market.exe" with the "-timerToggleFeature" launch parameter.

During the match, press the MMB (Middle Mouse Button) to start a 60-second countdown timer. You don't have to wait until it finishes; simply press the MMB again.

## Adaptive Crosshair
When option is active, the crosshair will be displayed as long as the right mouse button (RMB) is held down, and it will hide when the button is released. To enable this feature, launch the program using "Cursed Market - Crosshair Feature.bat" or run "Cursed Market.exe" with the "-crosshairToggleFeature" launch parameter.
